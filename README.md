# 🏙️ Airbnb Pricing Analysis
The goal of this project is to analyze Airbnb booking trends across multiple cities to uncover insights that could help increase guest satisfaction and revenue. Using SQL and Python, i explored patterns involving pricing, location, room type, and guest preferences. With a mix of statistical analysis, and colorful visualizations, I dove deep into location-based pricing dynamics.
